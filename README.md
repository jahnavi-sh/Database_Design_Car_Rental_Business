# Introduction
This project is part of a case study for designing a database system for a car rental business. The goal of the system is to streamline the management of customer reservations, vehicle tracking, branch operations, and employee management.

The database design uses a relational model with key tables for Customers, Vehicles, Reservations, Branches, Vehicle Reviews, Accident Reports, and Employees. The system is built to be scalable, secure, and efficient.

# Database Structure
The database contains the following key tables:

- Customers: Stores customer details such as name, email, and contact information.
- Vehicles: Stores vehicle information including model, type, availability status, and associated branch.
- Reservations: Tracks customer reservations for specific vehicles.
- Branches: Stores details of rental locations (branches).
- Vehicle Reviews: Captures customer feedback and ratings for rented vehicles.
- Accident Reports: Records incidents involving rented vehicles.
- Employees: Stores employee details and their roles within different branches.

# Data Insertion
You can find the SQL scripts in the repository for inserting sample data into each table. This includes customers, vehicles, reservations, branches, reviews, and accident reports.

# Sample Queries
This project also includes sample SQL queries to retrieve relevant data from the database. Example queries include:

- Fetching all reservations made by a customer
- Retrieving vehicle details for a specific reservation
- Generating reports on total revenue generated by a vehicle model
- Summarizing customer feedback for each vehicle
